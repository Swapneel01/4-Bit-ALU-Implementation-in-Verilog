# 4 Bit ALU Implementation in Verilog
<p> As part of a mini project, I made an ALU which can take combinations of 4 bits, and generate/ perform any of the mentioned 16 operations. This happens because of the conditional statement which checks the combination of the 4 bits. To run the code, simply download all the files, put them in a folder and import the folder in Vivado.</p>
